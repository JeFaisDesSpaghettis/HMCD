# HI3-Manga-~~PHP~~C-Downloader
C port of [HMPD](https://github.com/JeFaitDesSpaghettis/HMPD) that uses libcURL to download books(manhua, comic call it whatever you want) from the official HI3 COMIC, CN site (https://comic.bh3.com/) and GLOBAL site (https://manga.honkaiimpact3.com/).

## Why?
I wanted it to be easier to run and written in a more familiar and popular language and not mess with PHP(don't get me wrong it is a not that bad language but this is a desktop program).

Today everything needs internet and that is pretty annoying, one the biggest problems about HI3 (and so many other games) is the fact that it needs constant internet connection, and also game file encryption, if suddenly miHoYo shutdown or this game is blocked you can't do anything \
Sooo i wrote a script to download HI3 Manhuas and download them on whatever device that supports libCURL you want Windows, GNU-Linux or Android through Termux. \
So that we can at least keep this part of HI3!

## How to get it
Just go [there](https://github.com/JeFaitDesSpaghettis/HMCD/releases).

## Build
To build you'll need git, cmake, libcURL and a C compiler and then just run the bash/batch scripts.
