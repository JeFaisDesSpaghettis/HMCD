# HI3-Manhua-C-Downloader
HI3 that uses libcURL to download books(manhua, comic call it whatever you want) from the official HI3 COMIC, CN site (https://comic.bh3.com/) and GLOBAL site (https://manga.honkaiimpact3.com/).

## Why?
It allows you to read offline or archive the official hi3 manhuas releases in a easy way. \
Also today everything needs internet and that is pretty annoying, one of the biggest problems about HI3 (and games in general) is the fact that it needs constant internet connection, and also game file encryption, if suddenly miHoYo shutdown or this game is blocked you can't do anything \
Sooo i wrote a script to download HI3 Manhuas and download them on whatever device that supports libCURL, Windows, GNU-Linux or Android through Termux. \
So that we can at least keep this part of HI3!

## How to get it
Just go [there](https://github.com/JeFaitDesSpaghettis/HMCD/releases).

## Build
To build you'll need git, cmake, libcURL and a C compiler and then just run the bash/batch scripts.
